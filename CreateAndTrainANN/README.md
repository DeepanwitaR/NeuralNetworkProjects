# Create and Train a Neural Network with PyTorch libraries

Built a basic NeuralNetwork model with a single neuron to predict outputs related to insurance data imported from a CSV file. 
Implemented functions from scratch using PyTorch. 
Replicated the same with PyTorch Lightning which is a wrapper around PyTorch that lets us build neural networks with ease as it abstracts the granular details of the implementation. Used the same to build a basic classification model.
